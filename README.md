NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR
---------------------

This program is not even near completition, but I decided to release it as it's
perfectly capable of handling most every day use cases for the printer.

When looking at the code, please bear in mind that I'm not a programmer, and
this was the first GTK-Glade program I've ever done. I'll eventually clean it up
more and probably remove the GD depency aswell.

For any feedback, you can mail me at ari@sovijarvi.fi, or contact me via
IRC on EFNet, IRCnet or Freenode (my nick is 'APz').

Have fun!
